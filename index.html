      <h5 class="w3-center">A technological method of charity</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Cryptocurrencies are becoming an increasingly popular form of donation. Fidelity Charitable noted that cryptocurrency are the fastest growing category of assets donted, growing 140% faster than real estate, stock shares, and other illiquid assets. Cryptocurrency donations brings a number of benefits to the sector. It is faster, cheaper, and more transparent than fiat currency donation.
        This project aims to create an in-browser crypto miner as a new form of individuals to collectively donate to charities. Several charities have implemented group cryptocurrency pools to raise funds (see _ and _) and crypt-mining has been used to replace online advertisements on some websites.
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">In-browser cryptocurrency mining uses computer cycles to mine cryptocurrencies. The longer you are on the website, the more your computer mines and the more donations is given to the charity.</p>

      <h4>The Problem</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">In-browser mining is incredibly inefficient. Most crypto mining are done on machines with graphic cards. To be profitable, there must be a large number of individuals mining for more than 10 minutes at a time. </p><br>

      <h4>The Solution: The Solution: The Game</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The solution is to increase engagement to keep users on the miner for a long period of time.
        For this purpose, a simple game that largely replicates the Google Chrome dinosaur game is presented to the user.</p><br>

      <h4>The Cryptocurrency</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The website will use <a href="https://www.coinimp.com/">CoinImp</a>, a service that uses JavaScript for Browser Mining. It uses visitor CPU resources when you are on the website in replacement of advertisements.</p><br>

      <h4>What happens when you click 'The Game'</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">This website is simply examining how users will interact with the game and if it functions to keep people on it for a long enough time. There are no mining scripts that will be run at the moment.</p><br>
