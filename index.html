            <p class="w3-large">Cryptocurrencies are becoming an increasingly popular form of donation. Fidelity
                Charitable noted that cryptocurrency are the fastest growing category of assets donated, growing 140%
                faster than real estate, stock shares, and other illiquid assets. Cryptocurrency donations bring a
                number of benefits to the sector. It is faster, cheaper, and more transparent than fiat currency
                donation.

                This project aims to capitalize on the trend of cryptocurrency donation by creating an in-browser crypto miner as a new form of charity donation. Several charities have implemented group cryptocurrency pools to raise funds such
                as
                <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/feb/06/unicef-recruits-gamers-mine-ethereum-aid-syrian-children#:~:text=The%20UN's%20children's%20agency%2C%20Unicef,raise%20money%20for%20Syrian%20children.&text=Unicef's%20Game%20Chaingers%20scheme%20recruits,the%20currency%20for%20Syrian%20children.">UNICEF</a>.
              However, it has not been widely explored in the form of in-browser miners, especially after the discontinuation of CoinHive. The purpose of this website is to test user engagement and determine if in-browser mining coudl be a feasible method of charity donation in the future.

            <h4>The Problem</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey" style="text-align:left" style="padding: 10px">In-browser mining is incredibly inefficient. Most crypto mining are done on machines
                with graphic cards.
                To be profitable, there must be a large number of individuals mining for a long period of time.
                Therefore, there must be a large
                amount of user engagement.</p>
            <p class="w3-text-grey" style="text-align:left">Secondly, most in-browser miners used CoinHive to mine Monero. CoinHive became
                discontinued in 2018, resulting in a large number of these websites and miners to become obsolete.</p>
            <br>

            <h4>The Interdiciplinary Solution: Game Elements</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey" style="text-align:left">The solution is to increase engagement to keep users on the miner for a long period
                of time. In terms of in-browser methods to improve user engagement, games have often been implemented to entertain users.
              The longer you are on the website playing a game, the more your computer mines and the more donations is given to the charity.
                For this purpose, a simple game that largely replicates the Google Chrome dinosaur game is presented to
                the user with a few gaming elements that increases engagement.</p><br>

            <h4>The Project: </h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey" style="text-align:left">This project is to test the feasibility of using a game to improve the feasibility
                of in-browser
                mining for charity purposes. The website does not currently have a miner, and is more used as a test to
                see user engagement
                and determine mining profitability.

            <h4>The Cryptocurrency</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey" style="text-align:left">In the future, the website will use <a href="https://www.coinimp.com/">CoinImp</a>,
                a service that uses JavaScript for Browser Mining. It uses visitor CPU resources when you are on the
                website in replacement of advertisements.</p><br>

            <h4>What happens when you click 'The Game'</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey" style="text-align:left">This website is simply examining how users will interact with the game and if it
                functions to keep people on it for a long enough time. There are currently no mining scripts that will
              run on your browser.</p><br>
