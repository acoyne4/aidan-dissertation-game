            <p class="w3-large">Cryptocurrencies are an emerging and increasingly popular form of charity donation.
                Nonprofits such as <a
                        href="https://www.savethechildren.org/us/ways-to-help/ways-to-give/ways-to-help/cryptocurrency-donation">Save
                    the Children</a> and UNICEF are supporting and accepting crypto donations. Fidelity
                Charitable noted that cryptocurrency are the fastest growing category of assets donated, growing 140%
                faster than real estate, stock shares, and other illiquid assets. A <a
                        href="https://www.givingtuesday.org/blog/benefits-accepting-crypto-bitcoin-donations-givingtuesday">Global
                    NGO Technology Report</a>
                similarly found that cryptocurrency donations represent 1-5% of the used payment method for charitable
                donations with a +100% growth in some countries. The popularity of cryptocurrency donations largely
                comes from the benefits they bring to the sector. More money goes into the hands of the charity with
                crypto currency donations because of cheap transcation costs. Crypto donations are faster and are
                completely transparent.

                This project aims to capitalize on the trend of cryptocurrency donation by investigating the feasiblity
                of creating an in-browser crypto
                miner as a new form of charity donation. Several charities have implemented group cryptocurrency pools
                to raise funds such
                as
                <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/feb/06/unicef-recruits-gamers-mine-ethereum-aid-syrian-children#:~:text=The%20UN's%20children's%20agency%2C%20Unicef,raise%20money%20for%20Syrian%20children.&text=Unicef's%20Game%20Chaingers%20scheme%20recruits,the%20currency%20for%20Syrian%20children.">UNICEF</a>.
                However, crypto-donation has not been widely explored in the form of in-browser miners, especially after
                the
                discontinuation of CoinHive. The purpose of this website is to test user engagement and determine if
                in-browser mining could be a new method of crowd fundraising for charity in the future.

            <h4>The Problem</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey" style="text-align:left" style="padding: 10px">In-browser mining is incredibly
                inefficient. Most crypto mining is done on machines with sophisticated graphic cards. To be profitable
                on normal computers, there must be a large number of individuals mining for a long period of time.
            </p>
            <p class="w3-text-grey" style="text-align:left">Secondly, most in-browser miners used CoinHive to mine
                Monero. CoinHive became discontinued in 2018, resulting in a large number of these websites and miners
                to become obsolete without many alternatives.</p>
            <br>

            <h4>The Interdiciplinary Solution: Game Elements</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey" style="text-align:left">The solution being explored with this website is to increase
                user engagement by using gamification techniques. Motivation can be internally motivated through
                altruism and externally motivated through rewards. The altruistic act of charity drives internal
                motivation for users to stay on the browser. Meanwhile, a simple jump game drives external motivation
                through points and a leaderboard. The user gains the reward of  recognition by staying on the website
                for a long enough period to achieve one of the top scores. Additionally, a timer shows how long a user
                has been on the website and there will be a leaderboard of those who have been on the miner the longest
                implemented in the future.

            <h4>The Project: </h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey" style="text-align:left">This project is to test the feasibility of using a game to
                improve the feasibility of in-browser mining for charity purposes. The website does not currently have a
                miner, and is used as a test to determine user engagement and calculate mining profitability.

            <h4>The Cryptocurrency</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey" style="text-align:left">In the future, the website will potentially use services like <a
                    href="https://www.coinimp.com/">CoinImp</a>,
                a service that uses JavaScript for Browser Mining. It uses visitor CPU resources when you are on the
                website in replacement of advertisements.</p><br>

            <h4>What happens when you click 'The Game'</h4>
            <p class="w3-text-grey" style="text-align:left">This website is simply examining how users will interact
                with the game and if it functions to keep people on it for a long enough time. There are currently no
                mining scripts that will run on your browser. Cookies will be stored only for 14 days, which is the
                test period of the project. Everything else is anonymous and no other data is collected.
